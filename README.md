PROBLEM STATEMENT
TITLE: SCHOOL EQUIPMENT LENDING PORTAL
Problem Statement:
Schools often lend shared items like sports kits, lab equipment, cameras, musical instruments, and
project materials to students and staff. Currently, this process is managed manually, leading to missing
records and scheduling conflicts.
You are required to build a web-based Equipment Lending Portal to manage and track borrowing
requests, approvals, and returns efficiently.
Your task is to build a School Equipment Lending Platform that allows:
 Students and teachers to request or borrow equipment
 Lab assistants/admins to approve, issue, and track items
 Administrators to monitor usage and availability




CORE FEATURES:
1. User Authentication &amp; Roles
 Login/signup for students, staff, and admins
 Role-based access (student, staff, admin)
 Simple token-based login (simulated)

2. Equipment Management
 Add, edit, or delete items (by admin)
 Each item has a name, category, condition, quantity, and availability

3. Borrowing &amp; Return Requests
 Students can request equipment
 Staff/admin approves or rejects requests
 Mark as returned when completed
 Prevent overlapping bookings for the same item.

4. Dashboard - Equipment Listing &amp; Search
 List all available equipment
 Search/filter by category or availability

5. Basic UI &amp; Navigation
a. Responsive React frontend with clear navigation

ADDITIONAL ENHANCEMENTS (CHOOSE ANY OF THE BELOW BASED ON GROUP MEMBERS)
 Due Date Tracking and automatic overdue notifications
 Request History and usage analytics
 Damage/Repair Log for equipment maintenance
